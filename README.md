# MLAlchemy

## Overview
MLAlchemy is a Python-based utility library aimed at allowing relatively safe
conversion from YAML/JSON to SQLAlchemy read-only queries. One use case here is
to allow RESTful web applications (written in Python) to receive YAML- or
JSON-based queries for data, e.g. from a front-end JavaScript-based application.
